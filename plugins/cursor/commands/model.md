!`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cursor-companion.mjs" model $ARGUMENTS`

Present the output to the user.

- With no arguments, the command lists all models (same information as before under `/cursor:models`) and shows whether a workspace default is set.
- With a model id, it saves that model as the default for this workspace; `/cursor:task` and `/cursor:review` then use it when `--model` is not passed.
- With `--clear`, the workspace default is removed so Cursor Agent falls back to its own default.
